# capital-flight
2017 paper examining Bitcoin usage to circumvent Chinese capital controls

###Disclaimer
I wrote this paper a while ago, and a lot of my personal views on both crypto and Chinese regulation (& writing ability lol) have evolved.  Please take all commentary with a grain of salt.  The purpose of re-publishing this paper was strictly to surface what I believe to be a very interesting methodology to evaluate the prevelance of capital flight.

Please feel free to reach out with any feedback!
